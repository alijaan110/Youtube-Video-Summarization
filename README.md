# Youtube-Video-Summarization
YouTube summarization condenses key points from videos into brief overviews. Using tools like `pytube`, the audio is extracted, transcribed with models like Whisper, and summarized using Hugging Face's T5. This allows users to quickly grasp essential content without watching the entire video, saving time and providing concise insights.
